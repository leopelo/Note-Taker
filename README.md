# Note-Taker

## Description

The Note Taker app is an application that contains both front end and back end components. The back end component was designed using Node.js and its modules, including 'express', 'uuid', and 'fsUtils'. The application allows the user to create notes with a title and a body and to save them on the left side of the screen to be viewed. Said notes are also stored in local storage. The user can also delete the notes. The later function is still in development.
